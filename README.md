# Course title: Reinforcement Learning

Project type: (very enjoyable) university assignments

Programming language: MATLAB

In this repo, you'll find two folders: 


This repo contains two projects worked on during a course at Edinburgh University called Reinforcement Learning. The projects were written in MATLAB and consisted of implementing policy improvement (a reinforcement learning algorithm) in order to allow a car to learn how to act in order to score the best in a mini-game in which it had to avoid grass and cars to score well. In the first assignment, the agent (the car) has access to the map of the game, and in the second, it did not know where it was in the grand scheme of the game but could only see a a little way ahead of itself. In the second assignment, the car didn't do as well but was more representive of an agent which could learn in a real-world environment as opposed to in, for example, a research lab where all conditions are already known.
